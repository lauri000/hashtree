Scoop packaging notes

This manifest is a template for a Scoop bucket entry.
Update the version and SHA256 after each GitHub Release.

Steps:
1) Create a GitHub Release tag (e.g. v0.2.4) so the Windows zip asset exists.
2) Download the Windows asset and verify its SHA256 (or use the .sha256 file).
3) Update version and hash in hashtree.json.
4) Submit to your Scoop bucket.
